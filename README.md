Cypress Projects

Added .gitignore file - skip the files that are not needed to be checkedin to git repository.
Added node_modules/ , so other team members do not need to get this folder from git.
Now if your teammate wants to execute the test, they can just run the command npm install. It will install download all the dependencies from the package.json file and will automatically create a node_modules folder in their machine.
